Nacht neither endorses nor suggests any specific novel source, and there isn't a single superior extension. Instead, we encourage users to invest some time exploring various sources independently to determine which ones align best with their preferences. What suits one user might not necessarily suit another, and personal experimentation is key.

:::note[Disclaimer]
Nacht does not host any content, and we have no affiliation with or responsibility for any sources that may experience issues such as slow performance, downtime, missing chapters, or poor translation quality.

## How do I request a new extension?

Open an issue on [Github](https://github.com/nacht-org/nacht_sources/issues/new). if one does not already exist.
