## HTTP error 429 (Too Many Requests)

An HTTP error 429, often referred to as "Too Many Requests," occurs when the source temporarily restricts your IP address due to excessive downloading or rapid reading. We recommend [reporting](https://github.com/nacht-org/nacht_sources/issues/new) the issue to enable the implementation of rate limits, preventing future IP bans.
